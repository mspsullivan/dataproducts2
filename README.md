This app shows NCAA basketball data.
Each line is for one team and shows shooting percentage, win percentage and rank (as of 3/8/2016).

The data was pulled the data from NCAA.com.
You can see how the teams cluster based on the team statistics.
Change the number of clusters from 5 to 6 or 7 and see how the teams stratify.

K-Means does clustering takes all of the input and creates new factors using principle component analysis.
So, you don't see any one of the input columns in the final cluster comparison, but what you do see is
the clusters by the two components that give the most information.
